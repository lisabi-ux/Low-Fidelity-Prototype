# Low Fidelity Prototype - OutWrite Magazine Website

### DH150 Assignment06: Low Fidelity Prototype by Naomi Deng

Brief Summary

- User Research: My user research focuses on the experience of UCLA students that belong to the LGBTQ community. Two of my main questions are 1. Whether UCLA students feel comfortable expressing their identity to others?  2. Whether UCLA students feel there are enough resources to find belongingness, comfort, and support. To grasp a more personal and closer understanding of these questions, I chose to interview a fourth-year International UCLA student from China, Ruchen. Ruchen self-identifies as bisexual, and she conveyed her experiences at UCLA to me. From her answers to my questions on the interview script, I learned that the size and scope of the UCLA college community create difficulties for students to find appropriate support and LGBTQ resources, let alone joining an organization. Moreover, LGBTQ groups still face everyday difficulties caused by misunderstanding, confusion, and discrimination. Lastly and most essentially, international student groups do not receive sufficient recognition and specialized support. This has resulted in more hardships while international students are coping with their everyday experiences, in addition to cultural shock and nostalgia. My user research largely inspired me while creating my persona and scenarios, where I decided to incorporated what I have learned and observed from the interview. 

- Persona & Three Features: According to my heuristic evaluation and user research, I designed three personas that target on exploring and resolving issues for three different website features. The first persona is a 19-year old, female international student named Shu Li. She self-identifies as bisexual (bicurious since high school) yet she does not receive proper support and resources from her hometown back in China. Thus, she is looking to find more LGBTQ resources on an international scope on the website. This persona is largely inspired by my interview during the user research process.  Subsequently, the feature provided by the website is a separate page heading (hyperlinked), named “International” on the home bar. Through clicking “International”, Shu will be taken to another page with International resources, information, and content. The second persona is a middle-aged Chinese American Jack Wang, whose son is going through a gender transition and he wants to learn more and resolve the issues created by lack of information. Accordingly, the feature designed for Jack’s purpose and characteristics (technical unfamiliarity),  is a “Help” page where he learns how to use the “Search” function to funnel information of his interest (transgender). Lastly, the third persona, Tim Benson, is an interviewer in his early twenties. His purpose in using the website is to find relevant people to interview, thus to get to know whether college students in the LGBTQ community have sufficient on-campus resources. If not, how he can help them gain support. The feature designed for Tim’s purpose is a distinctive “About” page on the home bar, where he can learn everything about OutWrite Magazine in a nutshell, and find the right people to contact through clicking the convenient hyperlinked “Contact Us”. 

- Purpose: I have three purposes for Low-Fidelity Testing. Firstly, to test whether the features I designed for each of the personas work for people in reality. I want to observe and interview whether they feel weird about the features. Secondly, to inquire and innovate solutions. I would like to ask my tester if they feel weird about the feature, how would they like the interactions to be and how would they feel comfortable with using each feature.  Moreover, I to ask my tester (after the testing) whether there should be additional features they would like to see on the website. I would like to free myself from what I have done previously, and put myself in my tester’s shows and listen to their suggestions.
