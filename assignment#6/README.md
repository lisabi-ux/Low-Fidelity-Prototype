# Low Fidelity Prototype - OutWrite Magazine Website

### DH150 Assignment06: Low Fidelity Prototype by Naomi Deng

#### Brief Summary

- User Research: My user research focuses on the experience of UCLA students that belong to the LGBTQ community. Two of my main questions are 1. Whether UCLA students feel comfortable expressing their identity to others?  2. Whether UCLA students feel there are enough resources to find belongingness, comfort, and support. To grasp a more personal and closer understanding of these questions, I chose to interview a fourth-year International UCLA student from China, Ruchen. Ruchen self-identifies as bisexual, and she conveyed her experiences at UCLA to me. From her answers to my questions on the interview script, I learned that the size and scope of the UCLA college community create difficulties for students to find appropriate support and LGBTQ resources, let alone joining an organization. Moreover, LGBTQ groups still face everyday difficulties caused by misunderstanding, confusion, and discrimination. Lastly and most essentially, international student groups do not receive sufficient recognition and specialized support. This has resulted in more hardships while international students are coping with their everyday experiences, in addition to cultural shock and nostalgia. My user research largely inspired me while creating my persona and scenarios, where I decided to incorporated what I have learned and observed from the interview. 

- Persona & Three Features: According to my heuristic evaluation and user research, I designed three personas that target on exploring and resolving issues for three different website features. The first persona is a 19-year old, female international student named Shu Li. She self-identifies as bisexual (bicurious since high school) yet she does not receive proper support and resources from her hometown back in China. Thus, she is looking to find more LGBTQ resources on an international scope on the website. This persona is largely inspired by my interview during the user research process.  Subsequently, the feature provided by the website is a separate page heading (hyperlinked), named “International” on the home bar. Through clicking “International”, Shu will be taken to another page with International resources, information, and content. The second persona is a middle-aged Chinese American Jack Wang, whose son is going through a gender transition and he wants to learn more and resolve the issues created by lack of information. Accordingly, the feature designed for Jack’s purpose and characteristics (technical unfamiliarity),  is a “Help” page where he learns how to use the “Search” function to funnel information of his interest (transgender). Lastly, the third persona, Tim Benson, is an interviewer in his early twenties. His purpose in using the website is to find relevant people to interview, thus to get to know whether college students in the LGBTQ community have sufficient on-campus resources. If not, how he can help them gain support. The feature designed for Tim’s purpose is a distinctive “About” page on the home bar, where he can learn everything about OutWrite Magazine in a nutshell, and find the right people to contact through clicking the convenient hyperlinked “Contact Us”. 

- Purpose: I have three purposes for Low-Fidelity Testing. Firstly, to test whether the features I designed for each of the personas work for people in reality. I want to observe and interview whether they feel weird about the features. Secondly, to inquire and innovate solutions. I would like to ask my tester if they feel weird about the feature, how would they like the interactions to be and how would they feel comfortable with using each feature.  Moreover, I to ask my tester (after the testing) whether there should be additional features they would like to see on the website. I would like to free myself from what I have done previously, and put myself in my tester’s shows and listen to their suggestions.

#### Reflection: 

- Testing Process: 

  - What went smoothly: Firstly, the tester managed to complete three tasks. Prior to the testing, I had concerns with my hand-drawing and its effects on the tester’s ability to complete three tasks. Especially for task #1 – to find the “Help” page, learn how to use the “Search” function and use the search function to search the keyword “Transgender”. As it is shown, this particular activity/interaction sequence is relatively more complex than for example, task #2, to find the “International” page through the home bar and go to that page. However, my tester finished all three tasks regardless of complexity level, though task #3 required more time. Moreover, My tester provided some very useful information that helps the revised version of the prototype. Prior to the testing, I have no information on my tester’s website usage (e.x. would she recognize a convenient web feature? Does she have preferred websites that she thinks are easy to use.) It turns out that my tester has some level of knowledge about web design, and when I ask her what she thinks of a certain feature, she offered me insights, as well as examples she considers, could be a promising model for changes and modifications. 
  
  - What went differently than expected: First of all, a simple task might take a long time for the tester to figure out what to do. Take task #2 for example, my tester went through a lot of trouble to recognize the home bar on the home page (first wireframe on the left top corner), and then it took her a long time to figure out how to go to the “International” page. This might be largely due to my hand-drawing and the fact that my wireframes are small and thus, not as informative as expected. Furthermore, The tester needed to learn the information as she is completing the task. As the time goes by, she got nervous because she felt like failing a task (like she is being tested) Thus, the nervousness affected her confidence in completing a task and she started to go back to, or even randomly go to different wireframes for information. This might be due to my unclear arrow direction.  

  - What I would change : First of all, I would draw on a larger paper. The tiny frames restricted the amount of information contained in each wireframe and thus affected the tester while the tester was trying to comprehend the features as well as while she was completing the tasks. Because of the restrictions of space, I could only represent plenty of words and buttons with tiny fonts and elements. If I would change and redo the testing, I would change to a larger paper where each wireframe could be bigger, and thus clearer for the tester to see and learn. Moreover, I would consider using balsamic or other online low-fi prototyping software. This is  an alternative option for a more smoothly testing process. I would choose to use this software to create more organized, size-unified and well-formatted wireframes and thus there wouldn’t be errors due to comprehension of hand-drawing and size of wireframes. Lastly, I would ake sure to check with my tester about the testing method (drawing on a paper or on the iPad) she is  most comfortable with. I chose to let my user draw on the iPad (Cabinet application) because of the convenience for recording and thus documenting the process. However, I failed to consider how my tester feels and what methods she prefers to use. (e.x. whether she likes to use hand to draw on a paper or to use electronic devices) If I were to do the process again, I would provide her with both options and make sure she chooses the one she’s most comfortable with. 

  - Feedback in question format
 
  1. Confusion regarding the interaction sequence: “What is this frame about?” “Where does it take me to?” “Is this an arrow?”
  
  2. Confusion about the function design and consistency: “Why can’t I directly use the search bar?” “What if I want to see more?” “Why does this page have a scroll bar but that page does not have one?” 
  
  3. Confusion about the interactive elements: “Is this a button/hyperlink?” “Should/Can I click here?”


- Revised Prototype Explained: 

![p2 revisions](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59623164/74707778-a4039600-51cf-11ea-9ce7-800b393c84c2.jpeg)

  1. Added scroll bar on each wireframe for consistency
  
  2. Modified the content to comply with reality and provide more clarifications of the function behind this feature (Help page)
  
  3. Redesigned the Search Bar. In prototype #1 the home bar takes the user to a separate page. In the revised version the search bar has its own pop-up box
  
  4. Redesigned the website layout (added a side bar and categories in the content, such as “News” and “Politics”) to comply with the original website design, – no more “can I click here” issues
  
  5. Added “suggested keywords” and “last-time searches” to comply with convenient and realistic website design 
  
  6. Redesigned the website layout for the search results
  
  7. Added finger tip icons as an indication of the hyperlink function
